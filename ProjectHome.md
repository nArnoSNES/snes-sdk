SNES-SDK is a C toolchain and libraries targeting 65816 systems, specifically the Super NES (aka Super Nintendo, Super Famicom). It consists of a version of TCC equipped with a 65816 code generator and modified versions of WLA-DX (assembler and linker) and SNES9x (emulator for running the test suite). It is extremely hacky and very unpolished, but it passes a substantial part of the GCC test suite and even has floating-point support. It also comes with a version of the demo game for the SNES pseudo-C compiler SNESC which has been translated to proper C.
